Here is the link to my Gingerbread Man Run game: https://leighlewis25.github.io/gingerbreadgame/gingerbread.html.

The object of the game is to keep the gingerbread man away from the hungry people. The game begins with the gingerbread (the player that follows where your mouse goes) and one hungry person (the enemy that follows after the gingerbread man). After every five seconds, a new hungry person will appear, increasing the difficulty of the game.

Move your mouse away from the hungry people to keep the gingerbread man safe. Each time a new person appears, your score will increase by one point. Every time you run into a hungry person, your health bar will decrease. If you see a santa hat, that is free health. Try to go over to the santa hat, and your health will increase. When the health bar gets to zero, the game will end. You can click to restart the game.
